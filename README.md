# threadstr

This is not currently functional!  Very incomplete!

*Threadstr* is a system that creates what is essentially a message board thread, but not attached to an actual message board.  The idea is that discussions can be created in an easily sharable form on social media.

A planned feature in the future will be debate threads-- Text debates in which the server will act as a moderator.
